## Introduction

    I work in education, and it is important that I monitor student's effors.
Sometimes students are not working hard, and others there is cheating.  I am
sharing my research into this area.



Analysis #1:
![alt text](https://github.com/jim-cassidy/scool-cheating-detection-AI/blob/main/screenshots/screenshot1.png)

For this student, I noticed a lack of effort, claiming understood material, but when I asked questions
the student did not.  I went back through all the practice tests, I found out that there was a high score of
70%, but a downward trend after five practice tests.  There should be an upward trend, or at least a stable
horizontal trend.  I am also seing a lot of variation.  

Conclusion:

I am seeing a lack of effort, and great variation.  If that 70% was real, then very little effort is being
put in.  She did score a high score on a progress test, so this could be a lack of effort.
