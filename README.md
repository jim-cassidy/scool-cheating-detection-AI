# scool-cheating-detection-AI / effort

## Introduction

    I work in education, and it is important that I monitor student's effors.
Sometimes students are not working hard, and others there is cheating.  I am
sharing my research into this area.  I am going to start with old-school methods,
and then introduce deep learning.

## Method No. 1

    Use linear regression to see if any progress is being made
    
## Method No. 2

    Use standard deviation to see if the in-session work varies.  If scores are 
going up and down to much, it means cheating, or varying effort levels.


## Method No. 2

    Use Linear Regression, compare two different methods of student testing
to see if the trend matches.  If the regression is different, then potential
cheating is possible

## Method No. 3

    Use Tenrflow, and based on previous data, use deep learning so AI can automatically
detect cheating based on dats.
